# Fraud Detection

This problem is about identifying fraudulent transactions. 

> Credit card fraud is a growing concern in the digital age. Criminals steal credit card numbers by running scams or hacking into insecure systems. Stolen numbers are tested by making one or more small purchases, often for a dollar or less. If that works, they then make more significant purchases to get items they can sell or keep for themselves.
